# Pickle Ball Club Relational Database

- The task is to model and build a relational database for a pickleball club. This club offers lessons, has various levels of memberships, allows court reservations, and participates in tournaments. Our goal is to precisely model these relationships, create sample data, and populate the entities and their attributes accordingly. We aim to execute functional queries on this data to gain valuable business insights into the club and its activities.

## Data Model

![Data Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbowmn/4610project1/main/datamodel.png)

- In the pickleball club, members are able to take many lessons. Coaches are able to teach many lessons, and as a result, members that take multiple lessons may have multiple coaches. Members are also allowed to reserve a court throughout the year, and the same courts can be reserved multiple times. Each member is associated with only one membership, and each membership is associated with only one payment. A member of the club can be a tournament participant. Participants can compete in multiple tournaments, and tournaments can have multiple participants. These participants have game results that relate to the tournament they participated in.

## Queries
#### Simple
>Provide a list of all members who have taken lessons at the club. (Q1)
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT M.memberID, M.memberFirstName, M.memberLastName
FROM Member M
JOIN Lesson L ON M.memberID = L.memberID;
```
| memberID | memberFirstName | memberLastName |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 31       | Chloette        | Farries        |
| 70       | Leonie          | Jobling        |
| 115      | Marshal         | Tinto          |
| 123      | Alejoa          | Lovegrove      |
| 131      | Dix             | Sizeland       |

- This query lists all unique members who have taken lessons at the club. It joins the Member and Lesson tables on the memberID field. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that each member appears only once, even if they’ve taken multiple lessons. The result includes the member's ID, first name, and last name.

- This query helps managers identify members who are actively participating in lessons, which is key to understanding engagement. By knowing who is taking lessons, managers can offer targeted promotions to increase member retention. It also aids in operational planning by showing the demand for lessons, helping allocate resources like coaches and facilities. 

>Find the total amount of payments that have been made for memberships (Q2)
```sql
SELECT SUM(p.paymentAmount) AS totalMembershipRevenue
FROM Payment p
JOIN Membership m ON p.paymentID = m.paymentID;
```
| totalMembershipRevenue |
|------------------------|
| 53423                  |

- This query takes a sum of all the recorded payment amounts and joins the Payment and Member tables on the paymentID field to ensure payments are related to membership costs.

- This query allows the pickleball club management to have an idea of their revenue. Gross revenue is important to keep track of when running a business because it allows the club to allocate funds properly to tournament entry fees, coach salaries, court maintenance, and see what is making the most money.
- Note: Payments have minimum balance of 100, but partial payments are allowed. This query can help identify if the payments recieved do not meet the expected amount of income per membership plans.

>Provide the count of total tournament participants. (Q3)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.participationID) AS totalParticipants
FROM Participant p;
```
| totalParticipants |
|-------------------|
| 200               |

- This query retrieves the total number of unique participants in all tournaments. It counts the distinct participationID from the Participant table, ensuring that each participant is counted only once, even if they participated in multiple tournaments.
- Knowing the total number of participants helps in understanding the popularity and engagement in tournaments. This information is essential for event planning, resource allocation, and potentially adjusting marketing strategies to encourage more participation.

>Find the length of platinumn members' memberships. (Q4)
```sql
SELECT membershipID, membershipDuration
FROM Membership
WHERE membershipName = 'Platinum';
```
| membershipID | membershipDuration |
|--------------|--------------------|
| 11           | 6 months           |
| 12           | 9 months           |
| 14           | 9 months           |
| 22           | 9 months           |
| 23           | 12 months          |

- Selects membershipID and membershipDuration to display the membershipID of Platinum members, as well as the duration of their membership. 
- This query allows the club to recognize how long members have had the platinum membership. They might want to offer more benefits along with the higher monthly cost of this membership compared to others. After a certain number of months, they can offer discounts, free add-ons, etc. This will encourage members to upgrade to platinum, bringing in more revenue for the club.




#### Complex
>Display the distribution of membership tiers (and their respective prices) at the pickelball club. (Q5)
```sql
SELECT m.membershipName, COUNT(*) AS membershipCount, m.membershipPrice
FROM Membership m
JOIN Member mem ON m.membershipID = mem.membershipID
GROUP BY m.membershipName, m.membershipPrice;
```
| membershipName | membershipCount | membershipPrice |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Silver         | 54              | 200             |
| Bronze         | 53              | 100             |
| Gold           | 47              | 300             |
| Platinum       | 46              | 400             |

- This query counts the number of members in each membership type and displays the membershipName, the total number of members in each type (membershipCount), and the price for each membership type (membershipPrice). It joins the Membership table with the Member table using the membershipID field to link each member to their membership type. The query groups the results by membershipName and membershipPrice to get the count of members for each specific membership type.
- This query helps managers understand the distribution of members across different membership types and their associated prices. It provides insights into the popularity of each membership tier, allowing managers to adjust pricing, marketing, and resource allocation accordingly. Additionally, it helps forecast potential revenue from each membership category.

>Provide a list of coaches who have coached more than 5 lessons. (Q6)
```sql
SELECT C.coachID, C.coachFirstName, C.coachLastName, COUNT(L.coachID) AS totalLessons
FROM Coach C

| 6       | Claudell       | Baud          | 11           |

- We select the coach ID, coach first and last name, and count the coach ID as total number of lessons, signified by “totalLessons”. We join the lesson and coach tables on coachID and use GROUP BY to group the results by coach ID, first name, last name, and count how many coaches have taught more than 5 lessons.  
- This query allows the pickleball club to see which coaches are most active in teaching lessons. It helps management understand which coaches are putting in the most work and generating the most value for the club. This information is useful for decisions about raises, bonuses, scheduling, or seeing if a coach needs to be assigned more lessons.

>Find club members who have not made a court reservation (Q7)
```sql
SELECT M.memberID, M.memberFirstName, M.memberLastName
FROM Member M
LEFT JOIN Reservation R ON M.memberID = R.memberID
WHERE R.memberID IS NULL;
```
| memberID | memberFirstName | memberLastName |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1        | Marty           | Crooke         |
| 2        | Friedrick       | Kimmince       |
| 3        | Jaimie          | Bess           |
| 4        | Terese          | Aireton        |
| 8        | Wilbur          | Scryne         |
- This query lists all members of the club who have never made a court reservation. We use a LEFT JOIN between the Member and Reservation tables based on memberID. By filtering for results where R.memberID IS NULL, the query returns only those members who do not have a matching reservation record. The result includes the member's ID, first name, and last name.
- This query allows the pickleball club to see which members are not using the courts at all. It helps management figure out which members might be losing interest or are not taking advantage of their membership benefits. The club can use this information to reach out, re-engage these members, or offer incentives to get them back on the courts. Keeping members active is important for retention and making sure everyone gets value from their membership.

>Provide a list of members who have paid more than the average membership price. (Q8)
```sql
SELECT M.memberID, M.memberFirstName, M.memberLastName, MS.membershipPrice
FROM Member M
JOIN Membership MS ON M.membershipID = MS.membershipID
WHERE MS.membershipPrice > (SELECT AVG(membershipPrice) FROM Membership);
```
| memberID | memberFirstName | memberLastName | membershipPrice |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 38       | Griswold        | Bartholomieu   | 300             |
| 21       | Giustina        | Richardon      | 300             |
| 92       | Danie           | Freschini      | 400             |
| 46       | Layla           | Stote          | 400             |
| 45       | Bev             | Royle          | 400             |

- This query retrieves a list of members who are paying more than the average membership price at the club. We join the Member table with the Membership table based on membershipID. The query uses a subquery to calculate the average membership price and filters out any members whose membership price is less than or equal to that average. The result shows each member’s ID, first name, last name, and the price they’re paying for their membership.
- This query helps the pickleball club identify high-value members who are contributing in the top 50%. These members are likely more engaged and might be interested in premium services, loyalty perks, or exclusive events. The club should market more to these high paying customers.

> Provide a list of the available courts on the east side (Q9)
```sql
SELECT courtID, courtNumber
FROM Court
WHERE courtStatus = 'Available' AND courtLocation = 'East';
```
| courtID | courtNumber |
|---------|-------------|
| 10      | 3           |
| 11      | 4           |
| 24      | 12          |
| 54      | 3           |
| 57      | 4           |


- This query selects the courtID and courtNumber, using WHERE to specify the courtStatus as ‘Available’ AND courtLocation as ‘East’. 
- Helps the pickleball club quickly find which courts in the East location are available for use. Knowing the available courts in a certain location allows the owners and staff to easily track courts and assign courts to members who prefer playing in that specific area. It also helps with scheduling and managing maintenance for available courts.


> Display the number of reservations per court. (Q10)
```sql
SELECT C.courtID, C.courtNumber, COUNT(R.courtID) AS totalReservations
FROM Court C
JOIN Reservation R ON C.courtID = R.courtID
GROUP BY C.courtID, C.courtNumber;
```
| courtID | courtNumber | totalReservations |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| 13      | 1           | 16                |
| 2       | 2           | 4                 |
| 1       | 5           | 1                 |
| 10      | 6           | 3                 |
| 12      | 7           | 1                 |


- This query finds the number of reservations per court. It joins the Court and Reservation tables using courtID to connect each reservation to the correct court. The COUNT function totals the total number of reservations per court, and the GROUP BY groups the data by each court’s ID and number so that the reservation count is calculated for each individual court.
- Helps the pickleball club see how often each court is being used. Tracking the number of reservations for each court allows management to understand which courts are the most popular and which ones might not be used as much. This information is useful for scheduling maintenance, making improvements, or possibly deciding if new courts need to be added.

> Identify members who have participated in a tournament but never taken a lesson. 
 (Q11)
```sql
SELECT m.memberID, m.memberFirstName, m.memberLastName
FROM Member m
JOIN Participant p ON m.memberID = p.memberID
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM Lesson L WHERE L.memberID = m.memberID
);
```
| memberID | memberFirstName | memberLastName |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 6        | Shanta          | Daro           |
| 7        | Bobby           | Cubuzzi        |
| 15       | Ortensia        | Milsom         |
| 18       | Dav             | Pilmer         |
| 19       | Tiphany         | Gillion        |

- This query retrieves the memberID, memberFirstName, and memberLastName of members who have participated in a tournament but have never taken a lesson. It joins the Member table with the Participant table to identify members who have participated in a tournament, and the NOT EXISTS clause ensures that only members who do not have a corresponding record in the Lesson table are included in the result.
- Helps the club to identify which members to target in advertising for deals on lessons. The club may also want to offer free lessons to first-time participants, and this helps them to narrow down their search. If they know these members actively participate in tournaments, they will want to help them fine tune their skills so they can perform better. 


#### Notes & Assumptions
- For clarity and conciseness, queries were ran and results displayed with `LIMIT 5;`
- The pickle ball club is proud to be open 24/7 for its members
- Tournaments occur once per season, for a total of 4 a year.
